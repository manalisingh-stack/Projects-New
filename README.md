This Project focuses on bridging the gap between medical diagnostics and machine learning by developing a system capable of predicting diseases and recommending treatments with enhanced accuracy and efficiency. By leveraging advanced computational techniques, the system integrates Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) with the Random Forest algorithm to optimize the diagnostic process. 
PSO, a nature-inspired optimization algorithm, is employed to fine-tune the hyperparameters of the Random Forest model, ensuring optimal performance. This combination improves the accuracy, reduces computational complexity, and enhances the systemâ€™s capability to analyze vast datasets of symptoms, medical history, and demographic details. 
The application is built on a comprehensive and diverse symptom dataset, covering a wide range of diseases and conditions. This ensures robust predictions across varied medical scenarios. The dataset is processed using feature engineering techniques to handle missing values, reduce dimensionality, and improve overall data quality, which is critical for reliable diagnostic outcomes. 
To make the system user-friendly and accessible, modern visualization tools and interactive interfaces are incorporated. These tools allow healthcare professionals and patients to input symptoms easily, visualize diagnostic predictions, and understand recommended treatments. The user interface is designed to provide clear and concise outputs, enabling users to interpret complex medical insights effortlessly. 
The ultimate aim of this project is to empower healthcare professionals with a decision-support system and provide patients with a tool to better understand their health conditions. By combining machine learning with intuitive design, this project sets a foundation for future innovations in AI-driven healthcare, contributing to more accurate diagnostics, personalized treatment plans, and improved patient outcomes.
